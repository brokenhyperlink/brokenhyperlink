# Hello, I'm Alex!

I'm a software developer currently working on expanding my skill set on both the front end and back end of the software stack. I'm also reaching out and building a community of fellow tech workers. I like to pride myself on my ability to quickly get myself immersed in a tech stack and build on top of existing functionality. Continuing to improve my personal tech portfolio. 

I'm primarily working on vue.js, dotnet core and sometimes I even dabble in the dark arts PowerShell scripting.

Feel free to reach out. I'm always looking to build new connections and expand my skillset. 

Thanks for reading!
