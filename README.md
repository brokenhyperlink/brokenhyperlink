# Hello, I'm Alexandro! But you can call me Alex.

I'm a software developer currently working on expanding my skill set on both the front end and back end of the software stack. I'm also reaching out and building a community of fellow tech workers. I've got a wide range of experiences and pride myself on being adaptable to any given situation. A few technologies I enjoy working with are Express.js, React.js, and ASP.NET. And I'm still learning 😁. 

🔭 I’m currently working on a few personal projects showcasing my skills and aptitude in design and front end engineering. 

Ask me about keyboards and mountain biking 💬! 

😄 Pronouns: He/Him.
